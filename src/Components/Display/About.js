                Unlike other job portals, we provide a platform for Job Seekers to sell themselves,
                without the need for photos or names.<br/>
                <br/>
                What this means is, Recruiters can connect with the person you truly are underneath,
                without any prejudice to your race, religion or gender.<br/>
                <br/>
                With our platform, we hope that Occupational Inequality will soon become a thing of the past.
